- version 0.1.0: Initial version (June 2014).

- version 0.1.1: 
  Added -NTHREADS_swarp option for SWAarp 
        -NTHREADS_stiff option for stiff 


- version 0.1.2: 
  fixed functions:
    cross_RA_zero() 
    get_exposure_imsize_center()

  in both projectlib.py and projectlib_fromlist.py
  to account for missing CCD31. Now it probes for CCD in oppostites
  edges of the exposure

- version 0.1.3:

  * projectlib_fromlist.py

  fixed functions:
    cross_RA_zero() replaced by cross_RA_zero_center()
    get_exposure_imsize_center()

    Now, heck if crossing the RA=0.0 by the min and max values for the
    centers of all CCDs. We loop over all of the wcs of the
    images... slower (a few secs) but safer in case some CCDs are
    missing.  Now the the center of each CCD is computed. Also, if
    crossing RA=0, we subtract 360 from the values near 360


  * NEW: assess_SE_products.py : Robert's assesments script. Perfoms
  an assessent of exposures from a first/final cut run.  The quality
  of the exposures is based upon the seeing (FWHM), background, and
  extinction due to clouds

- version 0.1.4:
  
  assess_SE_products.py: update to behaviour when an astrometric
  solution is not found.

- version 0.1.5:
  assess_SE_products.py: added import math to main code.


- version 0.1.6:
  assess_SE_products.py:  fixed bug exp_rec["astro_sig2"] -->  exp_rec["astrom_sig2"]
